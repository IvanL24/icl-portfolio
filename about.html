    <p>
      Hello,
      I am Ivan Clarence Y. Lavena and I am a budding junior developer that enjoys building things from scratch. 
      I found front-end web development interesting for I can explpore different design ideas and apply them on a website.
      I am open for different opinions and criticism for I believe that this factors are what makes us succesful on whatever career we take.
